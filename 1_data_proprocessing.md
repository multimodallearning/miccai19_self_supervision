For our experiments, we use the contrast-enhanced thoracoabdominal CT scans of the VISCERAL Anatomy3 data set (1). 
Follow the instructions at the challenge website [VISCERAL Anatomy3](http://www.visceral.eu/benchmarks/anatomy3-open/) to get access to this data.

We perform the following steps to preprocess the silvercorpus data and subsequently the goldcorpus with its manually annotated organ labels.

1) At first, we isometrically resample a total of 63 silver corpus patients to a resolution of 1.5mm^3.
